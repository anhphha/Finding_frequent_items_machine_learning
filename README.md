# Finding_frequent_items_machine_learning

Arcada UAS | Project: finding frequent items (machine learning) | Tools: Python | Score: 4.0/5.0 | Project is about to find the frequent items and their item clusters by using different algorithms, thresholds, tuple sizes
- Found the frequent pair of items (2-tuples) using the naïve, A-priori and PCY algorithms
- Tested different parameters, such as hash tables, thresholds, tuple sizes
- Clustered for frequent candidates using the 1-NN criteria
